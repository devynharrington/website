I am a Senior VMware Cloud Foundation Consultant supporting federal and Department of Defense environments.



After nearly a decade in the United States Marine Corps as a Data Systems Chief, I transitioned into enterprise virtualization and cloud infrastructure consulting. Today, I specialize in VMware Cloud Foundation, NSX, and secure architecture modernization initiatives.



I hold a Bachelor’s in Technology Management, an MBA, and a Master of Science in Cybersecurity.
